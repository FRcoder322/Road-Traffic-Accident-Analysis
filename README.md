  # Description Of Dataset
   Understanding the patterns, causes, and factors contributing to road accidents.
   This case study involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on road traffic accident datasets to uncover
   key insights that can inform safety measures and policy decisions. 
   a)identifying trends.
   b)correlations


# Objective
  Case study is to conduct a detailed exploratory data analysis of road traffic accident data, identifying trends, correlations, and potential causes of accidents. 
  The findings from the EDA process will help:
  a)To generate data-driven recommendations aimed at improving road safety
  b)To reducing accident rates.
  c) To guiding future policymaking.

# Datasets Used
  US Accidents (2016 - 2023)
  Source: US Accidents Dataset on Kaggle
  Description: This dataset contains traffic accident records from multiple sources across the United States, spanning from 2016 to 2023. The data includes details such as accident severity, weather conditions, vehicle types, time, and location.

# Road Traffic Accidents Dataset
  Source: Road Traffic Accidents Dataset on Kaggle
  Description: This dataset focuses on the key factors influencing traffic accidents globally.
  
# Methodology
a) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  Handling Missing Values and Duplicates: 
  Date/Time Fields: Convert date and time fields to a more usable format 
  Standardizing Categorical Variables: 
b) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Univariate Analysis: analysis of a single variable or feature in a dataset:By using
    a)Summary Statistics: e.g mean,mode etc
    b)Visualization-eg Histograms,piechart etc

  Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: identify if and how the two variables are related to each other.
  a)Correlation-direction of the relationship between two numerical variables.
  b)Scatter Plots:A graph that shows the relationship between two continuous variables
  c)heatmaps
  
# Visualization & Insights
Bar Charts, Histograms, Box Plots, and Heatmaps: Use these visualizations to reveal patterns and distributions within the data.
Line Graphs: Display trends over time, such as how the number of accidents has changed year-over-year or by month.
Scatter Plots: Identify relationships between continuous variables, such as speed limit and accident severity.
